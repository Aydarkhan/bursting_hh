# Modeling pacemaker neurons with the Hodgkin-Huxley model

**Mini-project completed for the course Biological modeling of neural networks at EPFL.**

To understand a complex neural network, one has to know not only how its neurons are
connected together, but also how each of them behave. This has been the main concern of
Hodgkin and Huxley when they created their model to describe how a neuron behaves, under
different circumstances and in terms of ions, currents and voltages.

The goal of this project is of course not only to create an in silico implementation of the
Hodgkin-Huxley model using Brian, and playing with it as such, but throughout the project we
also create other classes of channels, such that the neurons start undergoing other behaviours,
to emulate behaviours different classes of neurons actually have in vivo.
